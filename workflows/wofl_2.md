### Butter, Bread, ..and Chocolate!

The butter and bread snippet!

```
git status
git add <files>
git commit 
```
Chocolate! Note: Do you want to stage and commit *all* your patches at once?
Use the following snippet. But be aware -- this can be desirable; it might not
be! ..Like chocolate.

```
git status
git commit -a
```

Note: `git commit -a` won't start tracking files. So if you're in a rush, don't
forget to tell Git it should track them!
