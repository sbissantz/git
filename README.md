# git 

Consider reading the tutorials in the following order:

1. [ssh.md](./ssh.md) 
2. [git.md](./git.md) 
3. [connect.md](./connect.md)
4. [git_gui.md](./git.md) [in progress]
5. [pull_request.md](./pull_request.md) 

[^1]: The `git` tutorial includes a couple of handy commands to operate with
  the command line. For now, those will do the trick.
