# git 

New to this repo? I recommend reading the files in the mentioned order. But
feel free to deviate from my advice. Wild click-throughs are exciting.

1. [ssh.md](./ssh.md) 
2. [git.md](./git.md) 
3. [connect.md](./connect.md)
4. [git_gui.md](./git.md) [in progress]
5. [pull_request.md](./pull_request.md) 

What else? Ah, there is a command reference: [reference.md](./reference.md) --
and I started gathering and documenting useful workflows.
