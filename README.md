# git 

Git grows vastly more important in the days of open science. As a consequence,
its usefulness increases rapidly. Yes, it is becoming more valuable for
scientists, too. Skills in version control are required everywhere; science,
industry, etc. Please, don't miss the boat! Every journey can seem tough, but
Git is worth it. I hope to convince you on the run. To share only one nugget of
truth: I started in 2019, and never looked back. But don't trust me. Be
skeptical and make your own experience. They pay off somehow. You will see.

But before we jump right into the action, let me eliminate possible prejudice.
You may have asked yourself: Isn't Git a place for the nerdy hacker dudes? It
was. Isn't Git brutal console KungFu I wanted to keep my handy off? Maybe. And
how the hell is Git supposed to help me out with getting things done? Good
question. Let me answer them all at once; regarding the framework, I did set up
for you:

Git is most powerful on the console. I know. But the console isn't the right
place to start. So we begin our journey by setting up a GUI (graphical user
interface) which allows you to make friends with Nanny McGill. Once you are
attached to it, you can't jump straight off the hook. Then it's time to spice
your Git taste with a breeze of the console. However, before you get too
excited, we'll end our journey. Reaching out for the stars is my part, bringing
them home will be yours. When you pushed the limits of the GUI version, you
will come back. And I will be waiting for you -- and all the questions that are
yet to come.

New to this repo? I recommend reading the files in the mentioned order. But
feel free to deviate from my advice. Wild click-throughs are exciting.

1. [ssh.md](./ssh.md) 
2. [git.md](./git.md) 
3. [connect.md](./connect.md)
4. [git_gui.md](./git.md) [in progress]

What else? Ah, there is a command reference: [reference.md](./reference.md) --
and I started gathering and documenting useful workflows.
